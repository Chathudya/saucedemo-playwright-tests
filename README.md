# ðŸ§ª SauceDemo E2E Automation Project

This repository contains an end-to-end test automation framework built for testing the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com) web application. The framework is designed using modern tooling, scalable architecture (POM), and enhanced with AI tools for speed and precision.

## ðŸ§  Test Strategy & Assumptions

### âœ… Coverage Areas
- Login Page (positive & negative flows)
- Product Listing & Product Detail Pages
- Add to Cart & Cart Summary
- Checkout (continue, cancel, complete)
- Form Validation & Error Handling

### ðŸ§± Test Design Principles
- Each page uses its own **Page Object** for modularity and reusability
- Locators are stored separately for easy maintenance
- Tags like `@sanity`, `@regression`, `@negative`, and `@validation` enable suite-based execution via `--grep`

### ðŸ§ª Execution Modes
- Run full suite: `npx playwright test`
- Run by tag: `npx playwright test --grep "@sanity"`
- Run specific file: `npx playwright test tests/login.test.js`
- Run in UI mode: `npx playwright test --ui`

## ðŸ¤– AI Tools Leveraged

| Area | How AI Was Used |
|------|------------------|
| Test Case Design | Generated and refined test scenarios for real-world relevance |
| Automation Coding | Rapid generation of POM classes, locators, and test logic |
| Optimization | Refactored test structure for scalability and readability |
| CI Integration | Helped create GitHub Actions YAML and reporting setup |

AI (ChatGPT-4) served as a **pair programmer + QA strategist**, speeding up delivery and reducing redundant work.

## ðŸ“¦ CI/CD Setup

GitHub Actions automatically runs:
- On every `push` or `pull_request` to `main`
- Generates and uploads a test report artifact

See `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` for config.
